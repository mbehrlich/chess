# Ruby-chess

I programmed this implementation of chess over the course of just two days in Ruby. It can be run from the console by 
typing:
```
ruby chess.rb
```
Some special features to look for:
- Every chess move works, including edge cases like promotion, en passant, and castling,
- Easy chess AI


### To do

Make the chess AI harder to beat!
